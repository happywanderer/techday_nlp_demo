Issue Identified 1: 
in the pull 'file.csv' all data is merged into ONE table. 
This is a problem when it comes to column names. 

How to solve:
Look at individual pulls for each source and develop list of names we can use to rename columns appropriately

Issue Identified 2:
in the data for TWITTER, we only see # of Followers.

How to solve:
Would like to see if we get actual follower/following names when pulling Twitter in by itself.
